| `expr: increase(mysql_global_status_innodb_row_lock_waits[2m]) > 0`                        | Triggers the alert if the number of InnoDB row lock waits has increased in the last 2 minutes. A value greater than 0 means at least one transaction has been blocked.                                      |
