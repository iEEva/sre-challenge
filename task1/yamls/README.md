### Yamls Folder

This folder contains all Kubernetes YAML configuration files used to deploy and manage the WordPress environment, monitoring stack, and supporting services in a Minikube-based cluster.

Each YAML file defines Kubernetes resources like Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and ServiceMonitors to ensure reproducible and declarative infrastructure.
