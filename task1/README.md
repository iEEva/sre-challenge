## Folder Descriptions

---

### Ports

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Access Info | Contains general notes, port mappings, service URLs, and access-related details. |
| Use Case | Helps track local service endpoints and handy startup commands. |

---

### Yamls (Kubernetes Resource Definitions)

All Kubernetes YAML definitions used to deploy and manage application components.

| File Name                            | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `wordpress.yaml`                    | WordPress deployment using Apache. |
| `wordpress-nginx.yaml`              | WordPress deployment using NGINX + PHP-FPM. |
| `mysql.yaml`                        | MySQL Pod and Service definition. |
| `nginx-config.yaml`                 | NGINX config exposing `/nginx_status` for metrics. |
| `nginx-exporter-service.yaml`       | Service that exposes NGINX Prometheus Exporter. |
| `nginx-exporter-servicemonitor.yaml`| Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` for scraping NGINX metrics. |
| `grafana.yaml`                      | Grafana deployment config (exported from Helm). |

> Grafana was originally installed using Helm:
> ```bash
> helm install kube-monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
> ```
> And later exported via:
> ```bash
> helm template grafana prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
>   --namespace monitoring \
>   --set grafana.enabled=true \
>   --set prometheus.enabled=false \
>   --set alertmanager.enabled=false > Yamls/grafana.yaml
> ```

### Forwarders

Scripts that automate and persist `kubectl port-forward` connections even after reboot.

| Included Scripts | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `grafana-portforward.sh`            | Forwards Grafana to `http://localhost:30000`. |
| `prometheus-portforward.sh`         | Forwards Prometheus to `http://localhost:30001`. |
| `wordpress-portforward.sh`          | WordPress (Apache) at `http://localhost:30081`. |
| `wordpress-nginx-portforward.sh`    | WordPress (NGINX) at `http://localhost:30082`. |
| `nginx-portforward.sh`              | Forwards standalone NGINX (custom port). |
| `nginx-exporter-portforward.sh`     | Exposes NGINX Prometheus Exporter at `http://localhost:9113`. |

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Port-forward persistence | Designed to work with `systemd` or manually in background. |
| Dynamic pod resolution | Uses label selectors to identify correct pods. |
| Wait logic | Checks that Minikube is running before starting the forward. |

## Why These Technologies Were Chosen

| Technology | Why It Was Chosen |
|------------|-------------------|
| **WordPress** | Popular CMS, container-friendly, highly relevant to infra/SRE roles. |
| **NGINX** | Lightweight, fast, and integrates well with PHP-FPM for WordPress. Offers `/nginx_status` endpoint for Prometheus metrics. |
| **MySQL** | Required by WordPress; easy to deploy and monitor in Kubernetes. |
| **Grafana** | Industry-standard for dashboards, alerting, and metric visualization. Used across real-world infra setups. |
| **Prometheus** | Pull-based monitoring, scrapes metrics from exporters and internal components. A key monitoring tool in most SRE stacks. |

---

## Summary

This setup was built to simulate a **production-style environment** with:

- Web hosting (WordPress + Apache/NGINX)  
- Database (MySQL)  
- Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)  
- Practical tools used by real SRE teams

> This stack replicates a realistic infrastructure for hands-on learning, configuration, and debugging â€” helping prepare for real-world operational scenarios.
